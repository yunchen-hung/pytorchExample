# pytorchExample

Implementing a Deep Averaging Network (DAN) model to compare performance against a Bag Of Words (BOW) model. Using PyTorch, I created a basic DAN model with pretrained embedding layers. Note - There are minor problems in this code.

To run the model, enter `python main.py --model DAN` in the terminal, and make sure `PyTorch` is installed. This should print out the test and dev accuracy, and the test and dev loss. The model for 2b. is printed as "2 layers, own embedding", while the original pretrained embedding layer is simply named "2 layers"
